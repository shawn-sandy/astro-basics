## Welcome to AstroKit

 AstroKit is a simple and easy to use starter kit for building blogs and websites sites with Astro. It includes features like MDX, syntax highlighting, and more. This site is built with Astro, so you can use it as a reference for building your own site. Find out more about Astro by visiting the [Astro docs](https://docs.astro.build/)

 ## Getting started guide

To get started with AstroKit, you can clone the repository from GitHub and run the following commands:
