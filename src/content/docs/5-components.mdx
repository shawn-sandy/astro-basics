## BlogPosts Astro Component

The `BlogPosts` component renders a preview for a blog post, displaying the title, description, and a link to the full post.

## Usage

```astro
---
import BlogPosts from './BlogPosts.astro';
---

const posts = [
  {
    title: 'First Post',
    url: '/posts/first',
    description: 'This is the first post' 
  },
  {
    title: 'Second Post', 
    url: '/posts/second',
    description: 'The second post is even better!'
  }
];

// Pass post data as props
<BlogPosts {...posts[0]} /> 
```

## CollectionList Component

This is the Astro component for displaying a collection list.

## Usage
The CollectionList component displays a title and list of posts from a collection.

```astro
---
import CollectionList from '../components/CollectionList.astro'
---

<CollectionList 
  collectionTitle="Latest Posts"
  collection="posts"
  pageSize={3}
/>
```


## Props

### The CollectionList component accepts the following props:

- collectionTitle (optional) - The title to display for the collection.
- pageSize (optional) - The number of items per page to display. Default is 3.
- to (optional) - The link for the "View All" button. Defaults to "/posts".
- collection (optional) - The collection to display posts from. Defaults to "posts".

### Functionality
- Fetches posts from the specified collection, sorted by published date.
- Displays the collectionTitle if provided.
- Maps over the posts and displays each one in a BlogPosts component.
- Limits the number of posts by the pageSize prop.
- Provides a "View All" button if the to prop is specified that links to the full collection.
- So in summary, it's a reusable component for displaying a sampled list of posts from a collection!
